# Histopathological-Cancer-Detection
Created an algorithm to identify metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans. The data used for this competition is a slightly modified version of the PatchCamelyon (PCam) benchmark dataset. The original PCam dataset contains duplicate images due to its probabilistic sampling, however, the version presented on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data) does not contain duplicates.
